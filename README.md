**LJIT2Win32**

A collection of LuaJIT FFI interfaces and utilities for programming in the Windows environment.

If you are interested in LuaJIT bindings for Win32, I strongly encourage you to take 
a look at TINN: 
http://github.com/wiladams/TINN

There are a lot more bindings, to a much broader set of Windows routines, and they're kept
more up to date.
